## Deck Dealer

A simple React project to draw random cards.

[Live Demo]

## What I learned:

- Used axios to retrieve data from an API
- Used state to store data and `componentDidMount()` to asynchronously make calls once mounted
- Display cards and using inline styles in React to generate random transformation and rotation
- Adding a reset button to restart state and make new call to API

## Open source API used:
